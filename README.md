### 🙂 About Me
<!-- I'm a Cybersecurity student based in Washington DC, with a passion for research and building ???. I'm a programmer, artist and storyteller. A renaissance man on a quest! -->

My name’s Anthony. The first thing you’ll learn about me: **I’m filled an insatiable curiosity to learn!** I like to introduce myself as “the digital autodidact” because I'm someone deeply driven by curiosity. Spend a day with me, and you'll quickly discover I'm the kind of person who strives to master technical **and** artistic disciplines. I make no distinction between technology and art — both are subjects that I love to immerse myself into and play with!

### 💼 Professional Background
I have over 9 years of experience in IT, particularly as a network administrator. A good chunk of my experience is derived from on-the-job training events during a 5 year enlistment in the US Marine Corps. After leaving the military, I explored the world a bit, working different jobs before deciding to return to the United States to attend college.

Currently, I'm two years into earning a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity from the SANS Technology Institute. In 2024, I had the privilege of interning with the Department of Energy as a frontend developer, where I contributed towards building a photography-based mobile app from scratch in six months.

### 🔨 What I Do
<!-- I specialize in front-end development and have experience with frameworks like React and Vue.js. Coding is my jam, and I love tackling complex problems with elegant solutions. -->

### 🤹 Interests & Hobbies
<!-- Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, photography, and painting portraits. I also have a keen interest in [related skill, e.g., machine learning] and am always eager to learn more. -->


### ❤️ Life Philosophy
<!-- I believe in the importance of continuous learning. -->
