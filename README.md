# Hello curious visitor! Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 😀

### 🙂 About Me
<!-- I'm a Cybersecurity student based in Washington DC, with a passion for research and building ???. I'm a programmer, artist and storyteller. A renaissance man on a quest! -->

My name’s Anthony. The first thing you’ll learn about me: **I’m filled an insatiable curiosity to learn!** I like to introduce myself as “the digital autodidact” because I'm someone deeply driven by curiosity. Spend a day with me, and you'll quickly discover I'm the kind of person who strives to master technical **and** artistic disciplines. I make no distinction between technology and art — both are subjects that I love to immerse myself into and play with!

### 💼 Professional Background
I have over 9 years of experience in IT, particularly as a network administrator. A good chunk of my experience is derived from on-the-job training events during a 5 year enlistment in the US Marine Corps. After leaving the military, I explored the world a bit, working different jobs before deciding to return to the United States to attend college.

Currently, I'm two years into earning a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity from the SANS Technology Institute. In 2024, I had the privilege of interning with the Department of Energy as a frontend developer, where I contributed towards building a photography-based mobile app from scratch in six months.

### 🤹 Interests & Hobbies
Outside of coding and studying tech topics, I enjoy making art! I'm a classically trained artist who likes to draw and paint portraits. I also have a keen interest in bullet journaling and creative writing. You'll quickly discover all my hobbies are intertwined with each other, as I like to make connections between everything I learn about!


### ❤️ Life Philosophy
> *"I wish to preach, not the doctrine of ignoble ease, but the doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife; to preach that highest form of success which comes, not to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to the man who does not shrink from danger, from hardship, or from bitter toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate triumph."*

If there's one philosophy I firmly stand for, it would be Theodore Roosevelt's "Strenuous Life" philosophy. I believe there is something special and admirable in any individual who voluntarily chooses to live a strenuous life, particularly in today's sendentary world. This ideal is beautifully illustrated in Xenophon's allegory, ["The Choice of Hercules"](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/manvotional-the-choice-of-hercules/). Its theme is powerfully summed up here in two statements:

> *"There can be no sweet without the bitter. No growth and no true happiness is obtainable without effort and without developing virtue"*

> *"Unearned comfort knows no nobility. Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life; to live so is to hoard up anguish, torment and remorse to be suffered later"*

I consider my life's mission is **to champion the Strenuous Life in the 21st century**. I shall do so by becoming a powerful Renaissance man who is a competent programmer, artist and storyteller. Learn more about the TSL philosophy here:

### 🧠 What I'm Currently Learning
I'm a college student. Right now, apart from attending classes, I'm studying for certifications like the CCNA and the AWS Certified Developer. I've already got a lot of knowledge from my military background, now I'm obtaining the degree and the credentials needed to be able to find reliable employment in the tech industry.
